## **About The Project**

![Microsoft Number Pad CSS Art Screen Shot](/images/numberpad-with-css-almiraverse%20-%20Copy.png)

This project is an *almost* replica of the Microsoft Number Pad designed as art made only out of HTML & CSS. It is the first piece of CSS art I created simply to see if I could do it (turns out I can!). 

*Project duration:* approximately 5 hours and 30 minutes.


### Built With
